Create a new folder

Drag all files from canvas (all .java plus the .policy)

Open Command console from the folder

In cmd, type javac *.java

Then type rmic MessageQueueImpl

Then type rmiregistry

Once done this, dont touch the command line. You need to open 2 more new cmd. 

So you should now have 3 command lines

In one of the new ones type java -Djava.security.policy=java.policy MessageQueueImpl and in the other java -Djava.security.policy=java.policy Factory 127.0.0.1
